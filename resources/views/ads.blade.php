            Why ads?
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            So why the Google ads? Well they are so I can pay for server hosting.
            And hopfully if there is any extra income it will give me motivation to
            keep updating the site.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            I figured that ads were a little better than than asking for donations. Although
            I might set up a system where users could pay an have ads removed.
