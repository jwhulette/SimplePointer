## Simple Pointer
![Build](https://github.com/jwhulette/SimplePointer/workflows/Build/badge.svg)


Simple Pointer is an agile pointing poker web app.

The app is free and does not require you to log in.

There are not a lot of frills, just a unique room for you and your team to use to use.


Create a room and then share the room link with your team.

Each member can log in as a player or an observer.

You can reuse the room link.


#### Dev Quick Start

If you just cloned the repo, run .dev-init.sh to stand up the rest of the app.
